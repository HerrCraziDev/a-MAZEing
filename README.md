# a-MAZEing
Maze generation and pathfinding using recursive algorithms and A* Pathfinding, developped in Purebasic as a personal experiment.

# Generation
A random maze is generated using a recusive algorithm, generating a continuous path on a grid. All the cases are linked to any other ones, there is no blanks or islands. Several different paths can coexist between two points.

# Pathfinding
(Not implemented) An A-star algorithm will be implemented. Other pathfinding methods may follow in a few time.
